# CS395T - Project 1 starter code
You should implement your yearbook or geolocation predictor in src. To get some
inspiration we included two baseline models (streetview_baseline and
yearbook_baseline) you should beat.


To evaluate your code store your model and all the required dependencies (including run.py) in a subdirectory of your choice. Then call
```bash
python grade.py directory_name
```
directory name should **not** include any slashes `/`.

You can run the baselines as follows:
```bash
python grade.py streetview_baseline
```
and
```bash
python grade.py yearbook_baseline
```


If you find a bug or something is unclear, please let us know on piazza or
through github issues or pull requests.
